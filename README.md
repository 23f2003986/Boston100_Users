# Boston100_Users

Data Scraping:
Data was collected through the GitHub API, targeting users from Boston with significant follower counts. The scraping process involved extracting user details, including their repositories, programming languages used, and engagement metrics. This information was compiled into structured CSV files for analysis, utilizing Python’s Pandas library for data manipulation and evaluation.

Interesting Findings:
The programming language with the highest average number of stars per repository: SQL. This indicates that while SQL may not be the most frequently used language, the quality and utility of SQL repositories resonate well with users, leading to higher recognition and appreciation.
The analysis of (high) correlation between a user’s followers and the number of public repositories they had indicated that users who create more repositories tend to have more followers, suggesting that active participation on the platform can enhance visibility and engagement.

Actionable Recommendation:
To enhance their chances of gaining followers and recognition, developers should consider focusing on building high-quality repositories in popular languages like SQL and JavaScript. Emphasizing well-documented code, building projects and respositories and engaging with the community can significantly increase visibility and attract more followers.
